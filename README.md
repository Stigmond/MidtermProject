# MidtermProject

  Here at crescendo, we believe in bringing people together from all musical backgrounds; whether they be hard-core enthusiasts and professional musicians or recreational listeners and budding song writers. Crescedo will allow users to come together like never before. 

  Crescendo is where the love for music is the language the people speak. Upload your musical art, listen to a song, rate an album, or have a fun debate on which album is the greatest of all time and more. You will be immersed in the world of music and culture by being connected to other users who have the same interests or possess musical talents or knowledge to share.
Because Crescendo is a blogging website, users can share musical knowledge such as musical tutorials, discussions, or album reviews in one central location. 

  Crescendo is a website based on social blogging. The site will be based on options for registered users and unregistered users to have different levels of access as well as an admin who can update and delete albums from the database. Unregistered users (the general public) can only read what has been posted, but cannot interact. People interested in registering will be sent to a page to create an account. One they have become registered, a user will have the ability to go to a page to create a new post about a topic. After posting, any registered user will have the ability to reply to any post, with the additional ability to reply to the replies. Registered users will have the additional option of being allowed to participate in the buying, selling, or trading of different musical goods. 



  A future stretch goal would be to have unpaid registered users will be required to have advertisements shown on their screen while interacting with the website. If they choose to become paid users, they will be redirected to a screen where they can give their payment information, which will be logged to their account. Once payment has been initialized, registered paid users will have the same read/posting ability without advertisements being shown on their screen.
Advertisements will always be shown for unregistered users.

  During this project we laerned how important good communication is and we believe this saved us from having to deal with too many merge-conflicts. While merge conflicts are scary, this project also gave us the opportunity to work through some and we found they were not as scary as they seem. We also became more familiar with pushing our current project sections to individual branches, thus saving us from the potential of an increased amount of merge conflicts.
